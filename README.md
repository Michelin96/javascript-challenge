Filtering data from a table using a web page search field.

# Synopsis and Usage

The index.html file in UFO-level-1 builds a table from the array of objects in static\js\data.js using the javascript in static\js\app.js. 

When opened in a web browser, index.html displays the whole table of UFO sighting data and provides a search field to filter sightings by date. The range of dates in the table is from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. Input any date in that range and click the "Filter Table" button or hit enter to filter the data. The table clears and only the data from that date is displayed.
